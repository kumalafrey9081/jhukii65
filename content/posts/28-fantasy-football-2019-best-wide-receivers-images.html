    <p><strong>28+ Fantasy Football 2019 Best Wide Receivers Images</strong>. Michael thomas has been one of the best wide receivers ever since he came into the league, and last year was no exception. Here are my 2019 wide receiver rankings, with notes on the top 24 plus three dozen more listed, as of aug.</p>

    <p>

                1.who do you think i&#039;m too high on? Hey all, wanted to get your opinions on my wide receiver rankings for 2020! You can use these rankings to find out who to start or sit on your.
    </p>

    <h3>After a year in jacksonville where he got paid $10m to share targets with.</h3>
    <p>In 2019 he had 86 receptions for 1,333 yards and 9 touchdowns, which was good enough for the no. Wide receivers are just about impossible to find after the top guys are snapped up. Jones figures to thrive next year with a new offensive coordinator, who will be better than steve sarkisian by default. The falcons, browns, and rams are all loaded with star wideouts.</p>
